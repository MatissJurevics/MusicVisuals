## oldCode/
This folder contains the old code for my first idea which I had to drop due to its heavy reliance on glsl shaders which
I could not get to work in the time frame. The code is still there for reference.

## Ideas
Generate patterns using symmetry and randomness. A seed is generated at the start and a pattern is created using that seed.

Some sort of genetic algorithm (like the slime mold one)

Fluid simulation : Cant do due to its heavy reliance on shaders. If i dont use shaders it will only work in real time at small resolutions.
